To connect remotely to your computer, run:
    sudo openvpn ~/Downloads/rthomp12_browncs.ovpn

To collect demos, in a separate window run: 
to turn on the robot: ros2_launch franka_bringup franka.launch.py arm_id:= fr3 robot_ip:=172.16.0.2 use_rviz=true
    to turn on cameras:  ros2 launch launch/launch_all_cameras.launch.py
    to close the gripper: ros2 action send_goal /fr3_gripper/grasp franka_msgs/action/Grasp "{width:0.0, speed: 0.3, force:75, epsilon: {inner: 0.02, outer: 0.02}}"
    to open the gripper: ros2 action send_goal /fr3_gripper/homing franka_msgs/action/Homing {}



TODOs: 
     - figure out how to get the moveit commands to run one at a time and not all at once
     - add the "predict relpose" thing and the rest of demo processing
     - add convex decomposition for motion planning in moveit
     - think through the whole pipeline and making that easier 
     - objective function debugging
     - figure out what is up with the cosine similarity thing and test for segmentation
